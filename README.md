# Knowing How to Use Terminal
I will talk about what I've read throughout the article of how the Terminal works on certain computers.

   When I first heard of using the text editors for coding on my computer, there had to be something to do with the use of a website. The author claims to have quite the
   difficulty when it comes to using certain fonts and themes for their websites. Not only that, he also mentioned how to get different software of text editors that I might want    to try out on my own. Another challenge he seemed to have was which one he would use the most when it comes to using the text editors, but it's usually because they're updated    he mentioned. If I had to choose a text editior software, it would have to be Brackets mostly because it stretches to both MacOS and Windows computers.
   
   I honestly have never used a Linux computer, although I've heard of the products before, it seems quite interesting now that I can explore the Terminal. For me, I use Windows OS so that mean I may have to use a software to download on my computer called "Putty".
